The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that can run on multiple platforms. The game will be called “Draw It or Lose It” and is currently only available on Android. The purpose of this game is to have multiple teams consisting of several people going four rounds at a minute each. When a picture is pulled from a library of images one team guesses till time runs out. If not answered each opposing team member gets to answer till 15 seconds runs out.
I felt that my strong point in this document was the use of the uml diagram. When creating code it can be difficult to see the flow of the code when it's just one line after another. The diagram helps you as you create the code and have a quick reference to see how your code is to be developed. it is also a quick reference to look back when you need to see another part of the code. This is helpful when your code has multiple files, so you don't need to keep switching between them.
the part that i had a challenge with was comparing the three operating systems. Since I have used primary Windows only, I needed to do a little more research on the other operating platform. This caused many challenges. The best way to overcome this was with patience and research.
